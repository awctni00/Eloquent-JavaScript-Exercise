# hello-world
by sam,

This is my Eloquent JavaScript Exercise, by the way I am a green hand in javascript and programming.
So in this process, lots mistake will be made.
If someone is in the same situation, I hope this could saved his/her time to search for the proper data.

For exercise in each chapter 
1. I record my version and my question.
2. Post the code that I find working successfully.
3. And blind spot about my knowledge, or the differences in the codes.
